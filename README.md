# Sales Documentation System 💼

## Overview
A terminal-based Sales Documentation and Management System built in **C++**. It demonstrates fundamental software engineering concepts including structural programming, role-based access control (RBAC), and basic state management.

## Features
- **Role-Based Authentication:** Distinct access levels for `Admin` and `Employee`.
- **Deal Management:** Employees can seamlessly add and document new client deals.
- **Notification System:** Internal messaging system allowing Admins to push notifications to Employees.
- **Data Encapsulation:** Utilizing C++ `structs` to model `User` and `Deal` entities.

## Tech Stack
- C++ (Standard Library)

## Future Improvements
- Transitioning from static global arrays to dynamic data structures (e.g., `std::vector`) for better space complexity and infinite scalability.
- Implementing file-handling for persistent data storage.
